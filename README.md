# Timeless Echo

**Timeless Echo** is a Flutter project that allows users to interact with a dynamic and engaging text-based interface, powered by Firebase for storing and retrieving game-related data. This app uses a combination of Firebase services and provides an interactive user interface with real-time data updates.

## Features

- Real-time database integration via Firebase
- Interactive text input and command processing
- Custom theme for both light and dark modes
- Dynamic content updates based on user inputs

## Requirements

To run the project, you'll need the following:

1. **Flutter SDK**: Install the latest version of Flutter. Follow the official installation guide [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. **Firebase Account**: You'll need to set up a Firebase account if you want to manage the backend (optional for development; default configuration files are included).
3. **Android Studio/VS Code (Optional)**: These IDEs can help in development but are not strictly required. Flutter works on any editor.
